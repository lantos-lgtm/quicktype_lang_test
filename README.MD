# quicktype language comparison

This is a small test that takes a JSON query from docker container stats and generates structures in different languages for JSON deserialization
This is not an objective test, it is just something to show the difference in deserialization and could be helpful in api rest requests.

note:
- rust can be made significantly smaller by using something like serde(rename_all)
